## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
#install.packages("knitr")
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)

fastfood <-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-09-04/fastfood_calories.csv")

```
-Display the first ten rows of the dataset.

```{r}
head(fastfood,10)%>%
  kable()
```

#Dislay the first five variables

```{r}
kable(fastfood[1:10,1:5])
```

#Display observations with more than 1000 calories

```{r}
filter(fastfood, calories>1000)%>%
  kable()
```

-Save observations that have more than 80 in total-carb and 40 in total_fat in the variable 'dont_eat_this'.

```{r}
#save
dont_eat_this <-fastfood %>% filter(total_fat> 40 & total_carb> 80)
#display
fastfood %>% filter(total_fat> 40 & total_carb> 80) %>% kable()
```

-From the initial dataset, display the observations from McDonalds.

```{r}
fastfood%>%filter(restaurant=="McDonalds")%>%kable()
```

#Part 2
-Display the variables with thw skimr package

```{r}
library(skimr)
skim(fastfood)
```

#summarize dataset

#Number of total observations in every restaurant.

```{r}
fastfood%>%
  count(restaurant, wt = NULL, sort = TRUE, name = "res_num") %>% 
  kable()
```

- Using groupings `group_by()`, summarise and display the average number of calories for each restaurant.

```{r}
fastfood%>%
  group_by(restaurant)%>%
  summarise(average_cal = mean(calories, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  kable()
```
- Add a variable to the dataset, which calculates the average calories per type of restaurant and call it `average_calories`.

```{r}
average_calories <-
  fastfood %>% 
  group_by(restaurant)%>%
  mutate(average_calories = mean(calories)) %>% 
  ungroup()
head(average_calories %>% select(restaurant,calories,average_calories))
```

- Display the data vis of total fat per each type of restaurant. Write a narration (2-3 sentences) why you believe this type of data viz presents such information best.


##### In this question, there are two types of variables(one is restaurant and another is total_fat). In ggplot2 cheat sheet, we need to identify the variables belong to discrete, continuous, both discrete or both continuous. Because restaurant belongs to `discrete` and total_fat belongs to `continuous`, I choose the bar chart for easy understanding the difference between each restaurant.


```{r}
# variable_x = restaurant (this is discrete) and variable_y = total_fat (this is continuous)
fastfood %>% 
  group_by(restaurant) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = restaurant, y = total_fat)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x="Names of Restaurant", y="Total Fat", title="Data Visualisation 1", caption = "Image 1:Bar Graph")
```

- Add a variable to the dataset, which calculates the maximum total fat per type of restaurant and call it `max_total_fat`.

```{r}
max_total_fat <- fastfood %>% 
  group_by(restaurant) %>%
  mutate(max_total_fat = max(total_fat)) %>% 
  ungroup()
head(max_total_fat %>% select(restaurant,item,total_fat,max_total_fat))
  
```

- Use observations for Mcdonalds to plot sugar variable against protein with `geom_point()`.

```{r}
fastfood %>% 
  select(restaurant, sugar, protein) %>% 
  filter(restaurant=="Mcdonalds") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sugar,protein)) +
  geom_point(colour = "blue") +
  labs(x="Sugar", y="Protein", title = "Data Visualisation - Mcdonalds", caption = "Image 2:Point Graph")
```

### **Part 3**

- Identify variable(s) which should be factors and transform their type into a factor variable.

```{r}
#install.packages("forcats")
#library(forcats)
#is.factor(fastfood$restaurant)
#as.factor(fastfood$restaurant)
```

- Add a new variable to the dataset `calories_type` using `cut_number()` function.Use `calories` variable for `cut_number()` function to split it into 3 categories `n=3`, add labels `labels=c("low", "med", "high")` and make the dataset ordered.

```{r}
calories_type <- fastfood %>% 
  group_by(restaurant) %>% 
  mutate(calories_type = cut_number(calories, n = 3, labels = c("low","med","high"))) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(calories_type)
head(calories_type %>% select(restaurant,item,calories,calories_type))
```

- Create a data viz that shows the distribution of `calories_type` in food items for each type of restaurant.Think carefully about the choice of data viz. Use facets, coordinates and theme layers to make your data viz visually appealing and meaningful. Use factors related data viz functions.

```{r}
calories_type %>% 
  group_by(restaurant) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(restaurant, calories_type)) +
  geom_boxplot(colour="red") +
  facet_wrap(vars(restaurant)) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="Restaurant", y="Calories Type", title ="Data Visualisation 3", caption = "Image 3:Plot Graph")
  
```

- Show the percentage of `trans_fat` in `total_fat` and add the variable to the dataset and call it `trans_fat_percent`.

```{r}
trans_fat_percent <- fastfood %>% 
  group_by(restaurant) %>% 
  mutate(trans_fat_percent = trans_fat / total_fat * 100) %>% 
  ungroup()
head(trans_fat_percent %>% select(restaurant,item,trans_fat,total_fat,trans_fat_percent))
#round(trans_fat_percent$trans_fat_percent, 2)
```

- Create a data viz that shows the distribution of `trans_fat` in food items for each type of restaurant.Think carefully about the choice of data viz. Use facets, coordinates and theme layers to make your data viz visually appealing and meaningful.

```{r}
ggplot(fastfood, aes(restaurant,trans_fat)) +
  geom_point(colour = "yellow") +
  facet_wrap(vars(restaurant)) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x="Restaurant", y="Trans Fat", title = "Data Visualisation 4", caption = "Image 4:Point Graph") +
  theme_dark()
```

- Calculate and show the average (mean) `total_fat` for each type of restaurant. No need to save it as a variable.

```{r}
fastfood %>% 
  group_by(restaurant) %>% 
  summarise(average_fat = mean(total_fat)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  kable()
```

- Create a dataviz that allow to compare different restaurants on this variable (`total_fat`). You can present it on one dataviz (= no facets).

```{r}
#ggplot(fastfood, aes(restaurant,total_fat)) + geom_col()
fastfood %>% 
  group_by(restaurant) %>% 
  summarise(average_fat = mean(total_fat)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(average_fat = fct_reorder(restaurant,average_fat)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(restaurant,average_fat)) +
  geom_col()
```
